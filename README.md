# al-wordle
In [Keith A. Brown's paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00787-7), active learning strategies are described by means of the game, wordle. Taking inspiration from the paper, I built a GUI for the game wordle that houses a few active learning strategies alongside for anyone to test out.
